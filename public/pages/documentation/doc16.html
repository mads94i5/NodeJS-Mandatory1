            <h3>Deployment</h3>
            <p>
                The process of deploying your application varies a lot depending on the service
                you decide on.
                Vercel is designed for serverless deployments, which means it's optimized
                for hosting static files and serverless functions. As a result you may run
                into problems trying to do some things.<br><br>
                Besides these limitations, it is very easy to set up a project with CI/CD on Vercel.
                You simply log in to the dashboard, click:<br>
                <i>"Add new" > "Project" > Select Git repository to import > Click "Deploy"</i><br>
                For this to work, you will need a "vercel.json" file in the root directory of the project.
                The .json file could look like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="json">{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
    {
        "src": "app.js",
        "use": "@now/node"
    }
    ],
    "routes": [
    {
        "src": "/(.*)",
        "dest": "app.js"
    }
    ]
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                "version": refers to the version of the Vercel configuration.<br>
                "builds": defines the build settings, it tells Vercel how to build the application and prepare for
                deployment.<br>
                > "src": defines the source file for the application, also known as the entry point.<br>
                > "use": tells Vercel to use a specific builder to build the project. In this case Node.<br>
                "routes": defines routing rules for the application, determining how incoming requests are handled.<br>
                > "src": here a regular expression is used to match all incoming paths.<br>
                > "dest": specifies destination for requests that match the source pattern, here directing them all to
                "app.js".<br><br>
            </p>
            <br>
