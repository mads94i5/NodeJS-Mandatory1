            <h3>Code conventions / Clean Code</h3>
            <p>
                These are principles and guidelines for writing code that is easy
                to read, understand, and maintain. It's a concept introduced by
                Robert C. Martin in his book "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
                Craftsmanship." The key idea behind Clean Code is to write code that
                is both functional and well-structured, making it easier for other
                developers to collaborate, modify, and extend.
                Not every principle has to be strictly followed, and few are universally
                agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more.<br><br>
    
                There are far too many principles to list here. So here is a link
                to a github repository about clean code for JavaScript:<br>
